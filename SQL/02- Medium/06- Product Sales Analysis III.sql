+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to Product table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.

Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.

Write a solution to select the product id, year, quantity, and price for the first year of every product sold. If any product is bought multiple times in its first year, return all sales separately.

Return the resulting table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+ 
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+------------+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
+------------+------------+----------+-------+ 
| 100        | 2008       | 10       | 5000  |
| 200        | 2011       | 15       | 9000  |
+------------+------------+----------+-------+


-- Answer:


-- 01
select S.product_id, FirstSale.first_year,
S.quantity, S.price 
from Sales S right Join 
(
SELECT product_id, MIN(year) AS first_year
 FROM Sales GROUP BY product_id       
) as FirstSale       
ON FirstSale.product_id = S.product_id 
AND FirstSale.first_year = S.year
ORDER BY FirstSale.product_id;


-- 02 Using Common Table Expression :
WITH FirstYear AS (
  SELECT product_id, MIN(year) AS first_year
  FROM Sales
  GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT S.product_id, F.first_year, S.quantity, S.price
FROM Sales S
JOIN FirstYear F
ON S.product_id = F.product_id AND S.year = F.first_year;
